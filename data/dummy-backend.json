      "info": "Finding returns is the point of investing, it’s the path to profits and prosperity. But how to get there – that’s the question investors need to answer. One common strategy – and one that offers plenty of promise for investors who don’t mind shouldering the extra risk – is to go after penny stocks. Traditionally seen as stocks priced for just pennies per share, these equities are now defined as those with a share price of $5 or less. For the tough-minded investors, these low-cost stocks present. The stock market is finding support right now from two directions, a perception that the Fed is turning slightly dovish and will be a little less aggressive on its rate hikes going forward, and the Q2 earnings, which are coming in better than analysts had feared. The S&P 500 might still be down 10% for the year, but the index has gained 17% since its mid-June low, and with the macro environment appearing friendlier, investors will be hoping the change of sentiment won’t be a temporary one.",

      "info": "The world’s nations continue to hold gold reserves in their central banks even as they’ve backed away over the years from considering it in terms of currency. The idea remains among experts that it’s probably a good idea to hold a reserve of the precious metal just in case. Gold has traditionally been seen as a hedge against inflation, which is a major concern of central banks. Other asset classes, some of them new and different, have begun to rival gold for this honor, but it's the precious met",

      "info": "Here's another cold, hard truth that many proponents of penny stocks don't tell you: Many low-priced shares stay low for a very long time. Hundreds of equities trade at a 'low' price on both the Nasdaq and the NYSE. So, how can you pick the winners consistently? Another challenge? Most institutional money managers don't touch cheap stocks. Imagine a large-cap mutual fund trying to buy a meaningful stake in a stock that trades at 30 cents a share. If it has thin trading volume, the fund manager will have an awfully tough time accumulating shares — without making a big impact on the stock price. IBD research also finds that dozens, if not hundreds, of great stocks each year do not start out as penny shares. Solid, expanding institutional buying among fundamentally strong companies with double-, triple- and even quadruple digit share prices makes up the I in CAN SLIM, IBD's seven-factor paradigm of successful investing in growth stocks.",

      "info": "Despite being one of the most recognizable wireless carriers in the U.S., AT&T stock has had a rough year. But it does have some perks. The firm reported second-quarter earnings on July 21 which sent shares down nearly 8% on the day. The recent earnings report also put shares below their 50-day and 200-day lines, which is a big negative. Investors ideally want to seek out stocks that are above support at their moving averages. AT&T stock had a rough second half of 2021. Shares attempted to breakout from a flat base with a 31.99 buy point earlier in the year. But the breakout failed in late May when share gapped below the 50-day line in heavy volume. Shares of AT&T then fell further below their 200-day moving average as well.",
